# LitClub

> A self-hosted platform for collaborative reading and book club management

## Overview

LitClub is a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between personal library management and the communal spirit of traditional book clubs. Unlike centralized services like Goodreads, LitClub gives small communitiesâ€”classrooms, families, reading societiesâ€”complete control over their data and reading experience.

## The Problem

Current reading platforms fall into two camps:
- **Cataloging platforms** (Goodreads, StoryGraph) excel at tracking books but lack meaningful community features
- **Communication tools** (Teams, WhatsApp) enable discussion but aren't built for literary engagement

Readers need a unified space that supports both personal library management and rich collaborative featuresâ€”all while maintaining autonomy over their data.

## What LitClub Offers

**Personal Library Management**
- Track books you're reading, want to read, and have completed
- Write private notes and reviews
- Organize your reading history

**Collaborative Features**
- Create and join book clubs with role-based permissions
- Schedule virtual and in-person meetings
- Share notes and discussion points within your group
- Participate in structured literary discussions

**Self-Hosted Architecture**
- Deploy on your own server or machine
- Full control over your data
- Customizable for different contexts (educational, personal, community)
- Export and import data for portability

## Project Structure

```
LitClub/
â”œâ”€â”€ Backend/          # Spring Boot REST API
â”œâ”€â”€ Desktop/          # JavaFX desktop client
```

The architecture separates the backend API from frontend clients, allowing for:
- A feature-rich desktop application (JavaFX)
- Future web client for basic access
- Potential for mobile clients

## Current Status

## Philosophy

LitClub is built on the belief that reading is both a personal journey and a shared experience. By putting control back in the hands of readers, we enable:
- **Privacy**: Your reading data belongs to you
- **Flexibility**: Customize the platform for your community's needs
- **Intimacy**: Small, purpose-driven reading communities without corporate oversight
- **Accessibility**: Self-hosting options for institutions and individuals

## Technology Stack
